# Deep-Learning-for-Anomaly-Detection


Anomaly detection has many important applications in real word problems such as to detect illegal activities, intrusions and health problem. 
However, even though significant effort has been devoted to this issue, the effectiveness anomaly detections in high dimensional data still remains an issue. 
As a response to that problem this project was done to examine the capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in detecting anomaly.
